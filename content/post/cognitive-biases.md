During my undergraduate studies in Business Administration I read a book about cognitive biases. It is more of a conglomerate of 52 biases that humans are exposed to when they make decissions. The book I read is named "Die Kunst des klaren Denkens - 52 Denkfehler, die sie besser anderen Ã¼berlassen" written by Rolf Dobelli. It was fascinating to read about these patterns and see if my own decissions might have been exposed to a cognitive bias - and certainly they were. Altough I was curious about it, it appread to me that my application of this knowledge was rather limited to my own person. This led me to forget most of it over time. Recently however, I remembered the book and re-read it. 

Data scientists are trained to follow the scientific method, that is to state a falsifiable hypothesis, collect data and infere whether the hypothesis can be proved wrong or kept for the time being. 

We need to be trained because our human brains are not trimmed to make objective and unbiased decissions simply because the evolutionary rewards of certain behavioral patterns saved our survival in the past. 

A major part of my work as a data scientist is helping people in the organization to make informed, data-driven and less biased decissions - this particular filed of data science is often called decission science. 

As the title of the book of Rolf Dobelli suggests there are many cognitive biases. I plan to write a series of blogposts on biases that for me appear to be the most present ones in the daily work of a data scientist. My aim is to provide a broader understanding of why people in the organization as well as oneself make certain decission and hence help the organization more effectively - in the end we all are only a human beeing and subject to biases. 

The series starts with one of the most present cognitive biases of all, the confirmation bias. 



In my first almost two years as a data scientist I analized several datasets and wrote reports to prepare decissions for other people in the organization. One thing I realized is that people often don't come with a problem, 

The first step is that people come to me with a problem they want to solve or a Hypothesis they want to have tested.

I guess, hello world! With my first blog post ever I want to talk about something more general: How do people gain knowledge about the world? As this may seem an obvious question for a data scientist to be answered by "of course, we follow the scientific method", this is not always true for regular people in an organization. 



What I recognized was that people had a clear opinion on how things work within their domain expertise. 

, however, based on a very biased way of obtaining this opinion. Tha

the decission-making process 


This is what I realized in my first almost two years as a practitioning data scientist. This becomes evident when you talk to people about an analysis that 



Let me elaborate on this quickly: 

Data scientists are trained to follow the scientific method, that is to state a falsifiable hypothesis, collect data and infere whether the hypothesis can be proved wrong or kept for the time being. However, we need to be trained because our human brains are not trimmed to make objective and unbiased decissions simply because the evolutionary rewards of certain behavioral patterns saved our survival in the past. 



want to address what a large proportion of my work as a data scientist is about, decission making. In my first almost two years as a data scientist I analized many datasets and wrote severl reports to prepare decissions for other people in the organization. One thing I realized is that people often don't come with a problem, 



A data scientist is helping people in the organization to make informed, data-driven and decissions. But why? 

Our human brains are not very trimmed to make objective and unbiased decissions simply because the evolutionary rewards of certain behavioral patterns saved our survival in the past. But today is different. We need to make objective, unbiased decissions to successfully navigate the competetive landscape of comapnies in the information age. 






I can give a number of examples where people have fallen for cognitive biases when making decissions - that is not only other people, but quite often myself. But the most frequent bias I am faced with when working as a data scientist in a company is the *confirmation bias*. 

<!-- Short and precise motivation goes here --> 


<!-- Description of the content goes here -->  
According to the confirmation bias our brain filters new information to only use evidence that *confirms* our beliefes. Hence, observations that do not align with our existing beliefs - the so called *disconfirming evidence* - will be ignored.

<!-- (Optional) example goes here -->  
Assume you work at a company that runs a website where you can buy some products. When you are serching for a product you get a list of similar products and you - as a company employee - want to find out why some products are clicked more often than others. The first thing your brain does is to formulate a hypotheses. This may be based on your own preferencees to only click on a product when the photo looks appealing. Hence, your hypothesis is that the quality of the main photo is correlated with how often the product is clicked. In the next step you look through the first say ten products and observe that two of them have bad looking pictures and are also not clicked very often. Hence your brain inferes that hypothesis is proved right? Is it? What you didn't observe was that there were three products that was also not clicked very often but have very nice looking pictures. However, if you would take these obervations into account it would destroy the hypothesis and this is exactly what our brain doesn't want.

<!-- What the take-aways are goes here -->  
If you find yourself in this situation try to fight your brain by finding evidence against your hypothesis. Try to challange your initial thought about how the world might work. Once you tried hard enough to find *disconfirming evidence* but you didn't find anything, your hypothesis is likeley to be right. However, you will never be 100% sure if your hypothesis is right. This is simply because the future is unkonwn and evidence against it might not yet be observable. 

I realized that being aware of these biases helps me not only to be a better data scientist as well as a better individual.
