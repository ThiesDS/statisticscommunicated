## Statistics communicated

This website is thought of as space where I communicate everything I produce within the field of data science. Why communicate? Data science is a field where communication matters. That is because as data scientist you will have to communicate to other professionals about current problems. You wil have to communicate to your computer to do things for you. You will have to communicate the results of your work as exciting story to different stakeholders. You also may - but not have to - talk to fellow collegues what you have learnt from past projects so they won't do the same mistake. And you may - but not have to - teach the next generation of data scientists by providing courses and workshops. 

If you want to learn more about me and my projects, check out my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/ThiesDS), where I communicate my software output. Or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Thies_DS) if you're interested in my mental dump. If you want to communicate directly, write a good old [E-Mail](mailto:thies@traum-ferienwohnungen.de).

## Data Science community

In the beginning of 2018 we started the local meetup group [Data-Lounge-Bremen](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Data-Lounge-Bremen/) to connect people in and aroung bremen that share interestes in all sorts of data topics. We try to organize one event in each quarter of the year. I am very proud to have such a nice community that is always willing to communicate their experiences. You are wecome to join us and, if you are interested, to give a talk on one of our meetup events.

## About Sven Thies

 I am a data scientist at [Traum-Ferienwohnungen GmbH](https://www.traum-ferienwohnungen.de/), a medium-sized company providing a two-sided marketplace for rental apartments in over 70 countries located in the city of Bremen. My background is in statistical finance and business administration. After my PhD at Bremen University, I slipped into data science like most of us. But after several years of experince I really can tell that I love to work in this field, talk about it and teach students how to become mini data scientists.
