At Bremen University I gave some lectures in statistics and econometrics. Currently, I am a lecturer at the FOM (short for *Fachhochschule für Ökonomie und Management*). Here is a list of my courses as well as workshops & trainings. As it is quiet hard to teach statistical concepts, in the FOM courses we try to expand the use of shiny applications to teach these concepts by making them more tangible. You can find these apps in this [GitHub](https://github.com/ThiesDS/Lehrapps) repository.
